# Lesion Spotlight

This extension provides an recent image segmentation and enhancement approaches in order to highlight abnormal white matter voxels in magnetic resonance images. At moment, there are available the LS Segmenter module (specific for hyperintense Multiple Sclerosis lesion segmentation on T2-FLAIR images) and LS Contrast Enhancement Module (specific to increase the contrast of abnormal voxels of the same T2-FLAIR images). The LS Segmenter module implements a hyperintense T2-FLAIR lesion segmentation based on a hybrid segmentation algorithm, published by Senra Filho, A. C. at DOI: . In addition, a simple implementation of another lesion segmentation algorithm is provided, being the method described in Cabezas M. et al. paper (2014) "Automatic multiple sclerosis lesion detection in brain MRI by FLAIR thresholding", Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine, DOI: 10.1016/j.cmpb.2014.04.006. More details could be found in the wiki page.
